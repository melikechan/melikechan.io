## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subfield of _AI_ _that is the science of programming computers so they can **learn from data** **without** being **explicitly programmed**._

In the past, people used to _write a lot conditions_, or make the computer search through _all the possible combinations._ 

However, with the help of machine learning, we can **teach** the computer to **learn** from the data and make **predictions**.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Given a **training dataset** and **corresponding _labels (or a target value)_**, the model learns to predict the labels by learning from the **training dataset**.
> Main problems: **Classification** and **Regression**.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Given a **training dataset** **without any _labels/target values_**, the model learns to find the **patterns** in the data.
> Main problems: **Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction** and **Anomaly Detection**.

3. **Semi-supervised Learning**: Given a **training dataset** with **few _labels/target values_**, the model learns to predict the labels by learning from the **training dataset**.
> Main problems: **Classification** and **Regression**, _same as supervised learning_.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns to make a **sequence of decisions**. The model learns to make decisions by **trial and error**. (by **rewards** and **penalties**).
> Main problems: **Playing a game (i.e. osu!)**, **Robotics**.

### Problems that Machine Learning can solve

We have seen some problems in the previous section, but let's see what they _actually_ are:

- **Classification**: Predicting the **category (also called as _class_ or _label_)** of a given data point.
    - It has three variations: **Binary Classification**, **Multi-class Classification** and **Multi-label Classification**.
        - **Binary Classification**: Predicting if the given data point belongs to _one of the two classes._
        - **Multi-class Classification**: Predicting if the given data point belongs to _one of the multiple classes._
        - **Multi-label Classification**: Predicting if the given data point belongs to _multiple classes._
    - **Example**: _Spam Detection (detecting if the e-mail is spam or not, **binary classification**)_, _Handwritten Digit Recognition (recognizing the digit from 0 to 9, **multi-class classification**)_.

- **Regression**: Predicting the **value** of a given data point.
    - **Example**: _Predicting the price of a house based on the features of the house (like number of rooms, area, etc.)_.
- **Clustering**: Grouping the data points into **clusters** based on the **similarities, patterns** in the data.
    - **Example:** _Analyzing the behavior of programmers based on the topics they are interested in_.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in the data. We reduce the number of the features to _reduce the complexity of the data_.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting the **outliers** in the data.
    - **Example**: _Detecting the fraudulent transactions in the bank, a classical example._
