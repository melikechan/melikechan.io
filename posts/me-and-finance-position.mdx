When I look at LinkedIn and see some people I know **personally** get a position as a quantitative analyst, I remind myself that I don't like working for _markets._

It is **not about** that my algorithmic skills are not competent enough to be a quantitative analyst.

Or it is not that I don't like _mathematics_ or _statistics or finance._ I actually like to _learn_ about the dynamics about the society: _Finance, psychology, even sometimes politics._

Because I think that having **ideals and seeking a better world** _satisfies me._ 

Seeing that I could contribute to the world by _contributing to the science_ makes me feel _happy._

I have always wanted to be a **scientist**, even when I was a child _(I wanted to be an **astronaut**, but it still counts as a scientist, right?)_.

Maybe I have a prejudice about this however I **hate** having goals like _making money_ or _being rich_. I think that _money_ is just a _tool_ to _reach_ your _goals_ or _to survive_.

Even though I could contribute to the science as a quantitative analyst, I still wouldn't want to be one.
